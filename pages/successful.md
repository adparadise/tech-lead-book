Beyond building what we're asked to do, success means a bit more to us.




## Sustained Velocity

* able to deliver features in reasonable timeframe
* healthy mix of feature development and cleanup
    * i.e not 90% cleanup, 10% features


## Meets all non-functional requirements

* Some call it quality
* Maintainable, Understandable, Extendable


## Heads in the right place

Devs end project

* content
* unstressed / refreshed
* clear

That is, they can keep going
