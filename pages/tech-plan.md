* can't do it all at once
* can't get it all right the first time

The meter needs to move forward even if the codebase can't right now

## The Tech Plan

A place to keep the plan for way things should be



## What it contains

* How to build new things better
    * don't copy the wrong examples!
* How to improve the things that exist
* How to find what needs changing
* Why this is an improvement
* The context that led to this conclusion

## How it's used

* when time affords, pick a cleanup and do it
* when it blocks other work, solve as much of it as makes sense


## Open Questions

* how to backreference it?
    * when you're in the code, how do you find improvements?
* How to make this practice sustainable? (only tech lead?)
